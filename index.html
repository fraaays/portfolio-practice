            <h3>TrafficEye</h3>
            <p>TrafficEye is a mobile application being designed to help citizens actively participate in 
road safety by reporting traffic violations in real time. By allowing users to capture photo or video 
evidence, submit detailed reports, and share some safety tips, and reminder through a community 
awareness feed, the app will empower the public to become the “eyes on the road.” It will also 
support authorities with a review system, online ticket issuance, and will ensure reporter 
anonymity, creating a safer, more transparent, and efficient approach to addressing traffic 
violations. </p>

            <h3>REAL’S FOOD PRODUCTS STOCKS AND MATERIALS 
MONITORING SYSTEM</h3>
            <p>In the fast-paced and quality-driven environment of food production, efficient inventory 
monitoring is crucial to maintaining smooth operations and ensuring product availability. Real’s 
Food Products, a growing enterprise specializing in snacks such as banana chips, taro chips, toasted 
pastillas, and dehydrated fruits, currently faces challenges in tracking the availability and usage of 
both stocks and raw materials. Without an organized system, employees often struggle with 
untracked supplies, misplaced items, and last-minute shortages that disrupt production. 
The absence of a structured stock and materials monitoring system has led to issues such 
as frequent unnecessary purchases, wasted resources, and increased transportation costs. For 
example, vital materials like plastic packaging, labels, and ingredients may go unnoticed until they 
are urgently needed, forcing the business to make repeated trips to suppliers and causing 
production delays. 
To address these operational inefficiencies, the Real’s Food Products Stock and Materials 
Monitoring System is proposed. This system will enable staff to monitor inventory levels in real
time, reduce waste, avoid duplicate purchases, and ensure that all necessary materials are available 
when needed. With this monitoring system in place, the business aims to streamline its stock 
handling processes, minimize costs, and maintain consistent product output, ultimately supporting 
better decision-making and enhancing operational productivity.</p>
